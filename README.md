# Super Prompt Generator for Financial Image Synthesis

This project fine-tunes the Mistral 7B language model to generate enhanced prompts for image generation using the Flux Schnell model. The model was trained on approximately 400 instruction-response pairs in JSON format. These prompts are specifically designed to produce images related to financial patterns, stock market behaviors, and trading terminologies. The aim is to automate high-quality, domain-specific prompt generation for better visualization in finance. The project supports custom input instructions and generates context-rich prompts suitable for downstream image synthesis models. All training and evaluation were done using Python and open-source tools.
